MERN Stack Test Web App

This project is a simple test application I built to get more familiar with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It is not a production-ready project — just a learning exercise to understand how the different pieces of a full-stack JavaScript application fit together.

Tech Stack

MongoDB – database for storing posts
Express.js – backend framework for handling API requests
React.js – frontend library for building the UI
Node.js – runtime for the backend server

Features

Create, read, update, and delete posts
Simple UI with Material-UI (MUI) components
File upload with Base64 encoding
Demonstrates RESTful API design
